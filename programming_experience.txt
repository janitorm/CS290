Up to this point, I've worked in Java, Python, JavaScript, C, and C++. I actually learned JavaScript while 


trying to make a web scraper as a personal little project and it was really fun and interesting! So I would 


say I have the least experience with JavaScript as I pretty much have used it only for that project (maybe 


3 months). Java I have worked with for about two years, Python just for the duration of this program so 


far, so about one year, and C and C++ I have about a year of experience with each. As for IDEs, I have 


worked with Visual Studio extensively in several languages. I've used both jGRASP and IntelliJ for Java 


and finally PyCharm for Python. As for classes, I've completed the two introductory courses into CS at 


OSU, discrete mathematics, assembly language and computer architecture. I'm taking this course now as


 well as web development. And at community college I took three classes in Java, a computer 


architecture course,  and an intro to programming class.
